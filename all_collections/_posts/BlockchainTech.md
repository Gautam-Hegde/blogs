## What is blockchain? ##

A blockchain is a decentralized, distributed, and public digital ledger that is used to record transactions across many computers so that the record cannot be altered retroactively without the alteration of all subsequent blocks and the consensus of the network. Blockchain is a type of Distributed Ledger Technology in which transactions are recorded with an immutable cryptographic signature called a Hash.
It is used to record transactions across many computers so that the record cannot be altered retroactively without the alteration of all subsequent blocks and the consensus of the network.
## Invention? ##
According to public transaction ledger, *Satoshi Nakamoto* created blockchain technology in 2008 so that he could accomplish it with the cryptocurrency bitcoin. The primary motivation for Satoshi Nakamoto's actions was his desire to establish a decentralised Bitcoin ledger, or blockchain, that would enable users to manage their money and prevent third parties like the government from having access to it or keeping track of it.
Many believe that this is not a person named Satoshi Nakamoto, it is just a fictional character. By the way, the correct information is not available from anyone about its veracity.

## *Hash function and its working* ##
A mathematical operation known as a hash transforms an input of any length into an encrypted output of a specific length. Therefore, its unique hash will always be the same size, regardless of the original quantity of data or file size involved. Additionally, since hash functions are "one-way," it is impossible to "reverse-engineer" the input from the hashed result using hashes.
Common hash functions take variable-length inputs and outputs that are fixed-length. Hash functions' message-passing abilities are combined with security features in cryptographic hash functions. In computing systems, hash functions are frequently used data structures for activities including verifying the accuracy of communications and authenticating data. Since they can be cracked in polynomial time, they are regarded as cryptographically "weak," but they are difficult to crack. Traditional hash functions are strengthened with security features by cryptographic hash functions, making it more challenging to decipher message content or sender and receiver information.
## Opportunities and advantages ##

- Manipulation is a problem that is resolved by blockchain. Everything is now held to the highest standard of responsibility as a result. decentralises the management of online reputation and identification. so that we can control our own data.
- In order to prevent anyone from having control over the value of currency, cryptocurrencies transfer this power from the government to the general public.
- The blockchain shields us from the middlemen in an informal economy, allowing for simple and unrestricted asset transaction. Data once entered the blockchain becomes immutable, which can no longer be changed in any way, which reduces the chances of fraud to a great extent. Apart from this, the transactions are very clear which can be easily investigated and audited later.
## Challenges ##
- Extremely Volatile Market
- Transaction speed: Transaction speed can also become a problem. Because we know that verifying the blocks in the chain is very important for the security of the distributed network and it takes a lot of time to do so.
- Consume Too Much Energy: These blockchains require a significant amount of computer power to operate, which increases the demand for electricity. In light of the current climate change crisis, it is not that simple to help any developing nation because they have their own requirements as well. Because of this, it only applies to developed countries.
- Illegal Activity: all transactions that occur on the blockchain are kept on the public record and are accessible to anyone for review, the identities of transaction makers remain unknown.
- Scalability Is An Issue
## Future of blockchain? ##
### *blockchain technology can disrupt financial services* ###
We must examine the shortcomings of the current financial system in order to comprehend how blockchain technology can disrupt financial services. At the moment, every transaction goes via a middleman, like a bank. To assure legitimacy, they go through a number of inspections and verifications.
Why is this risky and ineffective? First of all, because financial intermediaries store a lot of consumer information, they are susceptible to cyber-attacks. Second, because of the time and effort required for the checks and verification, customers lose at least a small percentage of their money.
What distinguishes blockchain technology? Blockchain is transparent and decentralised, to start. The user's identity is not necessary for the merchant to know. The user is therefore relieved of any concern regarding the sharing of their data. Simply send the vendor a confirmation of the payment.
The problem of inefficiency is the next. With blockchain, substantial sums of money can be quickly exchanged across international borders. If the intermediates handled the same transaction, it would take days.Finally, blockchain can allow anyone in the globe to invest and trade stocks. Trade may be made easier as a result, and new investors may emerge.
### *Supply chain transparency* ###
Consider the food sector. The roleplayers in the supply chain are typically unknown to business owners. Transparency is increased thanks to blockchain. For each product, it stores records that owners can trace. This can greatly simplify the auditing procedures and foster authenticity and confidence.
What issue is this a solution to? We are aware that errors in the food industry have the potential to negatively impact human life. Traceability is therefore essential for the food supply chain.
Traceability is a time-consuming operation under the current system because some parties are still keeping records on paper.
With blockchain, every stage of the transaction is digitally recorded and can be quickly and cheaply tracked back.
### *Cost-efficiency* ###
As was already mentioned, blockchain eliminates the middleman's transaction costs. The intermediates are replaced by the mathematical formulas. What does this actually mean? Less bank employees, no transaction fees, and lower overhead expenses result from this. In reality, the blockchain revolution could have an impact on those in the banking, contract, and settlements industries.
### NFTs ###
You will come across the unusual term *NFT*, or non-fungible token, if you search the internet. Another tendency that will be evident in 2022, particularly in the arts, is this one. Actually, NFTs can be anything digital. It may be a graphic or an audio file, for instance. NFTs are, to put it simply, tokens used to purchase digital art. Watch out for this trend if you're an artist, as NFTs have made it easier for creative to access decentralised funding possibilities.
## Conclusion ##
It is clear from this that people will not accept Blockchain technology so easily and it is not going to come overnight because it challenges traditional technology at every step.
Blockchains can be configured to work in a number of different ways, utilising various processes to establish a consensus on transactions that are only visible to authorised users and hidden from everyone else. The most well-known illustration of the scale of Blockchain Technology is Bitcoin. The creators of Blockchain are also experimenting with a wide range of other uses to raise the technology and influence of the platform. According to its popularity and success, it appears that Blockchain will soon govern the digital sphere
