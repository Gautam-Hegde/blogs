# Blogging Platform #

I write on topics that catch my attention.
*What's the point then*?
One of the best ways for me to spread my expertise to an audience is through blogging.

- bolster my subject knowledge. 
- Teaching something to someone else is the best way to truly master it.
- Learning in public!

*Any contributions in the form of code, issues, discussions are welcome!*
